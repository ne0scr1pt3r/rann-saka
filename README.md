  <p><strong>A comprehensive tool for evaluating unfounded allegations in the Cybersecurity domain.</strong></p>
</div>

In today's increasingly complex world, where cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities are evolving rapidly, there's a growing need for tools to navigate and understand the intricate landscape of workplace dynamics, especially in the cybersecurity sector. This tool is designed as an example to evaluate the likelihood of false accusations within a workplace, particularly against cybersecurity personnel. The tool does not delve into the root causes of verified false allegations. Instead, it serves as an initial step to recognize potential unfair treatment, prompting further investigation into why someone might be targeted with unfounded claims. Questions arise: Is it a matter of corruption, a preventive measure against uncovering workplace irregularities, or something else entirely?

The tool is intended for use by organizations and individuals in the cybersecurity field to assess the presence and severity of false accusations against their personnel. By evaluating a range of indicators, the tool helps in identifying patterns that might suggest unjust targeting or unfounded criticisms. It is particularly useful for cybersecurity professionals, including penetration testers, who may face unique challenges and misunderstandings due to the nature of their work. The tool's flexibility allows it to be adapted to various organizational environments, ensuring relevance across different workplace contexts.

To use the tool, users input data regarding specific indicators related to false accusations. These indicators are categorized and weighted according to their perceived severity and impact. The utility of this tool lies in its adaptability; users can modify the source code to add custom indicators, adjust weight modifiers, and define tiers for each indicator, tailoring the tool to their unique organizational needs. The output, a summary and a percentage score, offers a quantified assessment, guiding users towards areas that may require further attention or investigation. It's a proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential issues before they escalate.

This tool is an example of how tailored solutions can be developed to address specific challenges within the cybersecurity domain. As the landscape of cyber threats grows more complex, the need for nuanced and adaptable tools becomes increasingly essential. This tool exemplifies the kind of resource that can aid in navigating these complexities, offering insights and guidance in situations where the lines between true and false allegations may be blurred. It's a step towards empowering professionals to safeguard not only their digital assets but also their professional integrity and work environment.

The word "rannsaka" in Old Norse means "to investigate" or "to ransack". It is derived from the Old Norse elements "rann" meaning "house" and "saka" meaning "damage". Old Norse was a North Germanic language spoken in Scandinavia and other regions influenced by the Vikings and Norse culture during this time.

# Instructions for using the Rann-Saka program

## For Linux

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running `python3 --version` in your terminal. If it's not installed, install Python using your distribution's package manager.

### Steps
1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/ne0scr1pt3r/rann-saka.git`
3. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd rann-saka' 
4. Run the Python program: `python3 rann-saka.py`

## For Windows

### Prerequisites
- Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ne0scr1pt3r/rann-saka.git`
3. Navigate to the repository folder: `cd rann-saka`
4. Execute the Python script: `python rann-saka.py`

## For macOS

### Prerequisites
- Python usually comes pre-installed on macOS. Check its version with `python3 --version`. If necessary, install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps
1. Open the Terminal.
2. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/ne0scr1pt3r/rann-saka.git'
3. Change to the directory containing the program: `cd rann-saka`
4. Run the Python program: `python3 rann-saka.py`

## Running the program in a Web-based Python Interpreter

For instances where you cannot or prefer not to run the program locally, you can use a web-based Python interpreter. This is a convenient option as there's no need for any installations, and it works across all operating systems.

### Steps
1. Go to a web-based Python interpreter like [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) or [Repl.it](https://repl.it/).
2. Copy the Python code from the GitHub repository or upload the `.py` file, if the platform allows.
3. Run the code directly in the browser.

### Note
- Web-based interpreters may have limitations, especially regarding external library support and computational resources.
- Ensure the code does not contain any sensitive data or operations, as web-based environments may not be secure.
