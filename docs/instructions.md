# Installation instructions (Be sure to read the Usage instructions further down.)  

## For Linux

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running `python3 --version` in your terminal. If it's not installed, install Python using your distribution's package manager.

### Steps
1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/ne0scr1pt3r/rann-saka.git`
3. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd rann-saka`
4. Run the Python program: `python3 rann-saka.py`

## For Windows

### Prerequisites
- Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ne0scr1pt3r/rann-saka.git`
3. Navigate to the repository folder: `cd rann-saka`
4. Execute the Python script: `python rann-saka.py`

## For macOS

### Prerequisites
- Python usually comes pre-installed on macOS. Check its version with `python3 --version`. If necessary, install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps
1. Open the Terminal.
2. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/ne0scr1pt3r/rann-saka.git`
3. Change to the directory containing the program: `cd rann-saka`
4. Run the Python program: `python3 rann-saka.py`

## Web-based Python Interpreter

For instances where you cannot or prefer not to run the program locally, you can use a web-based Python interpreter. This is a convenient option as there's no need for any installations, and it works across all operating systems.

### Steps
1. Go to a web-based Python interpreter like [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) or [Repl.it](https://repl.it/).
2. Copy the Python code from the GitHub repository or upload the `.py` file, if the platform allows.
3. Run the code directly in the browser.

### Note
- Web-based interpreters may have limitations, especially regarding external library support and computational resources.
- Ensure the code does not contain any sensitive data or operations, as web-based environments may not be secure.

## Usage instructions 

### Scenario: Evaluating risk of false accusations in a cybersecurity team
**Context**: You are a cybersecurity team leader in a large organization. Recently, there have been concerns about the reliability and accuracy of the team's work, leading to potential false accusations against team members. You decide to use this program to evaluate the risk of such accusations and to identify any areas needing improvement.

### Starting the program
1. Run the program from your command line or preferred method.
2. **Choose Evaluation type**: You're prompted to choose between 'General Evaluation' and 'Cybersecurity Evaluation'. For this scenario, choose 'Cybersecurity Evaluation' by typing '2'.

### Responding to indicator questions
The program will present a series of indicators related to common issues that might lead to false accusations in cybersecurity work. For each indicator, think about the current state of your team and work environment before answering:

- **Example indicator**: "Inconsistent Testimony from Team Members (Differing accounts of events from team members)": 
    - **How to think**: Reflect on recent team meetings or incident reports. Have there been instances where team members gave conflicting information about security events? If yes, answer 'yes'. If such instances are rare or nonexistent, answer 'no'.

Proceed through each indicator, applying the same thoughtful consideration. Your goal is to assess honestly whether each statement applies to your team's situation.

### Completing the evaluation
After responding to all indicators:

3. **Reviewing the results**: The program will analyze your responses and provide a summary of the risk level for false accusations against your team. It may highlight specific areas where misunderstandings or miscommunications are occurring.

### Using the results
- **Develop a plan**: Use the insights from the evaluation to address identified issues. This might involve additional training, improving communication channels, or revising protocols.
- **Follow-Up your evaluations**: Regularly use this program to track improvements over time or to quickly identify new issues as they arise.

---

### In this scenario
- The program helps you systematically identify and address areas that could lead to misunderstandings or false accusations.
- By carefully considering each indicator, you can gain a clearer picture of your team's strengths and potential vulnerabilities.
- The ultimate goal is to foster a more transparent, efficient, and harmonious work environment, reducing the risk of false accusations and improving overall cybersecurity efficacy.
