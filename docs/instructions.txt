# Instructions for using the Rann-Saka program

## For Linux

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running `python3 --version` in your terminal. If it's not installed, install Python using your distribution's package manager.

### Steps
1. Open your terminal.
2. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/ne0scr1pt3r/rann-saka.git`
3. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd rann-saka`
4. Run the Python program: `python3 rann-saka.py`

## For Windows

### Prerequisites
- Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ne0scr1pt3r/rann-saka.git`
3. Navigate to the repository folder: `cd rann-saka`
4. Execute the Python script: `python rann-saka.py`

## For macOS

### Prerequisites
- Python usually comes pre-installed on macOS. Check its version with `python3 --version`. If necessary, install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Steps
1. Open the Terminal.
2. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/ne0scr1pt3r/rann-saka.git`
3. Change to the directory containing the program: `cd rann-saka`
4. Run the Python program: `python3 rann-saka.py`

## Running the Program in a Web-Based Python Interpreter

For instances where you cannot or prefer not to run the program locally, you can use a web-based Python interpreter. This is a convenient option as there's no need for any installations, and it works across all operating systems.

### Steps
1. Go to a web-based Python interpreter like [Repl.it](https://repl.it/), [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), or [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try).
2. Copy the Python code from the GitHub repository or upload the `.py` file, if the platform allows.
3. Run the code directly in the browser.

### Note
- Web-based interpreters may have limitations, especially regarding external library support and computational resources.
- Ensure the code does not contain any sensitive data or operations, as web-based environments may not be secure.
